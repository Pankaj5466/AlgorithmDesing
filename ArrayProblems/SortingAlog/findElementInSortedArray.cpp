Took me a while to sort out the cases. 
I always get stuck figuring out whether to use '<=' or '<' in these type of problems. In this case, while the binary search itself was fine (<=), while looking for the pivot, 
(a)I used '<'. Need to practice until this becomes second nature I think.
(b) Either that or just fix (<=) as the convention and take it from there.
